<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We respect your privacy and consider data protection an important part of how Uncle Vasya VPN operates. Below, we explain in simple terms what data we may collect, why we need it, and how we use it.</p>

<h2>Who We Are</h2>
<p>The Uncle Vasya VPN app was created by Ilia Kukshtel (IE, Georgia). If you have any questions, just contact us at <a href="mailto:support@someapps.dev">support@someapps.dev</a>.<br/>
Our website: <a href="https://someapps.dev" rel="noopener">https://someapps.dev</a></p>

<h2>Data We May Collect</h2>
<p>We do not track your internet traffic or store connection history. To ensure the app works properly and to provide user support, we may collect only minimal technical data, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>user identifier (to understand who you are in the system);</li>
<li>subscription and payment details (if you use premium features);</li>
<li>technical device information (device type, operating system, app version);</li>
<li>anonymous statistics to help us understand how the app performs and what can be improved.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Uncle Vasya VPN does not log, analyze, or store websites you visit or DNS requests.</strong></p>

<h2>Why We Collect Data</h2>
<p>We use the collected information to:</p>
<ul>
<li>ensure stable VPN performance;</li>
<li>fix bugs and improve performance;</li>
<li>assist users through support;</li>
<li>understand which features matter most and what to improve;</li>
<li>notify you about updates and new features (if you agreed to receive them).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How We Protect Your Data</h2>
<p>We use modern encryption methods and secure servers. Only people who truly need access to certain information for service operation have it — and only within their scope of work. We do not sell or share personal data with third parties.</p>

<h2>When Information May Be Shared</h2>
<p>Sometimes we use third-party services — for example, for analytics, subscriptions, or payment processing. We choose partners who treat data responsibly and comply with international security standards.</p>

<h2>Emails and Notifications</h2>
<p>From time to time, we may send helpful updates or information about new features. If you prefer not to receive such messages, you can unsubscribe with one click or email us at <a href="mailto:support@someapps.dev">support@someapps.dev</a>.</p>

<h2>Data Retention</h2>
<p>We do not keep data longer than necessary for the operation of the service. If you decide to stop using the app, contact us, and we’ll delete all information associated with your profile.</p>

<h2>Policy Updates</h2>
<p>We occasionally update this document to make it clearer or to reflect new legal requirements. The latest version is always available at <a href="https://someapps.dev" rel="noopener">https://someapps.dev</a>. By continuing to use the app, you agree to the latest version of this Policy.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>If you’d like to ask a question or clarify something, please write to: <a href="mailto:support@someapps.dev">support@someapps.dev</a>.</p>
