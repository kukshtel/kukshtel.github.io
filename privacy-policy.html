<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>We respect your privacy and consider data protection an important part of how our applications and services operate. This Privacy Policy explains what data may be collected, why it is needed, and how it is used.</p>

<li>technical device information (device type, operating system, app version);</li>

We do not sell personal data to third parties.</p>
<h2>Data Security</h2>
